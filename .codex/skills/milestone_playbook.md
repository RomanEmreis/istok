# Milestone playbook (istok)

Each milestone task must define:
- Scope (what is included/excluded)
- Acceptance tests (unit/integration)
- DoD checklist
- Notes on no_std/min-deps impact
- Scaffold files are part of the design; do not remove unless asked.

Prefer vertical slices: "end-to-end minimal" over "perfect subsystem".
